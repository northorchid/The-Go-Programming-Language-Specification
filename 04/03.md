## Semicolons

```
The formal grammar uses semicolons ";" as terminators in a number of productions. Go programs may omit most of these semicolons using the following two rules:
```

在很多编程语言语法使用分号";"作为结束符。Go语言在满足下面两条规则下将省略绝大多数的分号。

```
When the input is broken into tokens, a semicolon is automatically inserted into the token stream immediately after a line's final token if that token is
an identifier
an integer, floating-point, imaginary, rune, or string literal
one of the keywords break, continue, fallthrough, or return
one of the operators and delimiters ++, --, ), ], or }
To allow complex statements to occupy a single line, a semicolon may be omitted before a closing ")" or "}".
To reflect idiomatic use, code examples in this document elide semicolons using these rules.
