```
Line comments start with the character sequence // and stop at the end of the line.
General comments start with the character sequence /* and stop with the first subsequent character sequence */.
A comment cannot start inside a rune or string literal, or inside a comment. A general comment containing no newlines acts like a space. Any other comment acts like a newline.
```

多行注释从字符 /* 开始到字符 */ 结束
